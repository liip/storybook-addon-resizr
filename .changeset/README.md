# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Usage

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select the packages that have changed
2. Choose the type of version bump (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset will be stored in this folder and used during the release process to determine version bumps and generate changelogs.
